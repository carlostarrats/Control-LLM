# Problem Statement

## Core Problem
**As a user, I want to upload large PDFs and have the LLM answer my question regardless of any system constraints, and I can't do that right now.**

## What This Means
- Users should be able to upload PDFs of any size
- The LLM should process the content and answer questions about it
- System constraints (file size limits, memory, etc.) should not prevent this from working
- Currently, this functionality is broken

## What We're NOT Solving
- Individual symptoms like endless polling loops
- Chunking system issues
- LLM processing problems
- These are obstacles, not the core problem

## What We ARE Solving
- Making large PDF processing work end-to-end
- Ensuring users can upload large PDFs and get LLM answers
- Overcoming system constraints that prevent this functionality

## Success Criteria
- User can upload a large PDF
- User can ask a question about the PDF content
- LLM provides an answer based on the PDF content
- This works regardless of PDF size or system limitations
